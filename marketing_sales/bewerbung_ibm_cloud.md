# Overview of product and market:
The current times are challenging for us all and require radically new solutions to cope with new challenges and ensure safety for all citizens.
While social distancing and home office - wherever possible - is the new normal, people still need to shop groceries and refill their supplies.
To ensure social distancing and infection-free shopping experiences we have created SafeMarket during the #wirvsvirus hackathon to enable all citizens to prebook slots in supermarkets according to the forecasted customer-density within the market.

SafeMarket is a digital reservation system for customers to book easily a shopping ticket, using the SafeMarket app or booking a ticket through the hotline. Moreover we provide the cusomer the option to visit the supermarket when it is not overcrowded to reduce infections and minimized waiting queues in front of the stores. Another effect will be a more evenly distributed workload of the supermarket capaticy which results in a more secure environment for customers and employees, with an increased customer satisfaction. Also, the solution considers walk-in customers. We provide the shop owner the tools to split his capacity dynamicly to the needs of the market and the demand of SafeMarket.

During the hackathon solution our team implemented the following components: 
1. a flutter app for the customer to book a ticked
2. a vue.js app for the shop owner and doorman to maintain the store and check the tickets
3. a backend as web app in C#, to bring everything together 

While the hackathon the target was to get a first solution running, but this changed immediately after the hackathon. Due to our high motivation and passion for SafeMarket, we merged together with other teams. Also we were selected successfully for the “Solution Enabler” program supported by the German government. 

Right now we are working on rolling out the SafeMarket solution to real markets. To reach that goal we had to evaluate our components and compare them with the core requirements, to setup a scalable and easy to use solution. Also, we continuously developed our customer app, that is already deployed in a first beta stadium in the Google Play Store

Because of the very high potentiall and the oppertunity that our solution should be used in every store in Germany, we want to move our backend to a stable serverless architecture that is auto scalable. Our prefered choise is the IBM Cloud Functions FaaS platform, because IBM is a official part of the "Solution Enabler" program. Also some team members are IBMers and know how to use the IBM cloud already.

# Describe your target market:
The target market of our solution is very large with extreme potential, because people still need to shop groceries and refill their supplies. In the first step our target is to roll out SafeMarket in Germany, but from our point of view it is conceivable that the solution can be used in every store worldwide. 
In Germany stores are allowed to reopen, if the store is less than 800m2 and has a security concept against corona infections. SafeMarket could be one part of this concept!
